<h1>QuadraticEquationSolverPHP</h1>
<h2>A Quadratic Equation Solver written in PHP.</h2>

I originally wrote the Quadratic Equation Solver in C# and then again in Visual Basic. (It's usually the first program I
write when experimenting with a new language.)

I re-wrote this in PHP so that I could embed it onto a website.
